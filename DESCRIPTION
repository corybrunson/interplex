Description: This is a lightweight package to facilitate coercion (conversion)
    between data structures used by different packages to represent simplicial
    complexes. Currently supported structures are complete lists of simplices as
    used by 'TDA'; simplex tree instances, both as used by 'simplextree' and by
    Python GUDHI (by way of 'reticulate'); and the graph/network classes of
    'igraph' and 'network' by way of the 'intergraph' package.
