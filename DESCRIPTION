Description: This is a lightweight package to facilitate coercion (conversion)
    between data structures used by different packages to represent simplicial
    complexes. Currently supported structures are complete lists of simplices as
    used by 'TDA', simplex tree instances as used by 'simplextree', and the
    graph/network classes of 'igraph' and 'network' by way of the 'intergraph'
    package.
